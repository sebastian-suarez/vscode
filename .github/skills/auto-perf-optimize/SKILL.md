# VS Code Performance Workflow

Drive a repeatable VS Code scenario, collect memory/performance artifacts, verify that the scenario actually happened, then hand the resulting heap snapshots to the generic heap-snapshot-analysis skill when object-level investigation is needed.

## When to Use

- User describes a VS Code workflow and asks whether it leaks or grows memory
- User asks the agent to launch VS Code, drive a scenario, and capture heap snapshots
- User wants screenshots, `summary.json`, renderer heap samples, and targeted `.heapsnapshot` files for one scenario
- User wants a new automation runner for a VS Code scenario

Do not use this skill when snapshots already exist and the user only wants heap object/retainer analysis. Use heap-snapshot-analysis directly.

## The Story

1. **Define the scenario.** Write down one warmup action, one repeatable iteration, and one quiescent point where it is fair to force GC and sample memory.
2. **Develop the automation.** Start with a tiny no-snapshot run. If it fails or the UI state is uncertain, keep the Code window open, connect `@playwright/cli` to the same CDP port, take workspace-local screenshots, inspect snapshots, and update the runner's selectors/waits.
3. **Run a fast smoke.** Disable heap snapshots first. Prove the scenario completes and the artifact summary says what you think it says.
4. **Capture targeted snapshots.** Snapshot a warmed-up baseline and a later iteration. Do not snapshot every sample unless necessary; snapshots are huge and slow.
5. **Verify the run.** Inspect `summary.json` and screenshots. Do not analyze a failed login, trust prompt, stuck progress row, or wrong UI state.
6. **Analyze snapshots.** Switch to heap-snapshot-analysis for compare scripts, object grouping, and retainer paths.
7. **Fix and verify.** After identifying leaks, make product-code fixes. Then rerun the same scenario with the same snapshot labels and compare like-for-like. Do not stop at analysis — the goal is to ship a fix, not just a report.
8. **Document.** Save a summary of findings, fixes, and before/after measurements to session memory so the work is preserved.

## Checked-in Runners

The `scripts/` folder contains stable, generic helpers. Use them directly or as
templates for scratchpad scripts:

- **[userDataProfile.mts](./scripts/userDataProfile.mts)** — Utility for managing
  user-data profiles in smoke test runs.

Scenario runners themselves live in the [scratchpad](./scratchpad/) folder; see
"Develop and Watch a Runner" below.

**Safety: runs execute on the real machine.** The Code OSS instance launched by these
runners is a full VS Code on the user's actual computer — not a sandbox. Be responsible:

- **Use a throwaway workspace**, not the real repo. Pass `--workspace <scratch-folder>`
  pointing to a temporary or gitignored directory (e.g., the runner's scratchpad
  subfolder, or a folder under `.build/`).
- Pass `--keep-open` when the user needs to watch the window, then close the window
  before the next automated run unless intentionally reusing it.
- Pass `--reuse` only when attaching to a Code window that was launched with
  `--enable-smoke-test-driver` and the chosen remote-debugging port.

Important runner behavior:

- The default profile is persistent at `.build/auto-perf-optimize/user-data` so state can
  be reused by all runners in this skill.
- Pass `--temporary-user-data` only if a clean profile is part of the scenario.
- Pass `--seed-user-data-dir <path>` to copy an existing profile into a fresh target
  profile before launch.

## Profiles

Prefer the shared persistent performance profile for routine runs so extension state and
caches are warm and comparable between runs.

Seed-copy rules:

- The seed Code window must be closed. Never copy a profile while a Code process is using it.
- The target user-data-dir must be absent or empty. If the script refuses to copy, pick a
  fresh `--user-data-dir`, use `--temporary-user-data`, or delete the local target deliberately.
- The copy skips root-level caches, logs, crash dumps, singleton lock/socket files, and
  session storage. It intentionally keeps user/global storage that may contain extension state.
- Use explicit `--user-data-dir <fresh-path> --seed-user-data-dir <seed-path>` when you want
  to keep the copied profile after the run. User-provided `--user-data-dir` is never deleted
  by the runner.

## Develop and Watch a Runner

The first version of an automation runner is rarely correct. Treat the runner as a test you are developing: run a cheap scenario, observe the live workbench, adjust one selector or wait condition, and repeat. Do not collect heap snapshots until the runner is boringly reliable.

**New runners go in the [scratchpad](./scratchpad/) folder** (gitignored). Checked-in scripts in `scripts/` are stable, generic runners — don't modify them for a one-off investigation. Instead, copy patterns from them into a scratchpad script.

Organize scratchpad work into **dated subfolders** named `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description/` (e.g., `2026-04-09-editor-tab-leak/`). Each subfolder should contain:

- The investigation scripts (`.mts`, `.mjs`, etc.)
- A **`findings.md`** file documenting the full investigation: all ideas considered, which ones led to changes and which were rejected (and why), before/after measurements, and a summary of the outcome. This lets the user review the agent's reasoning, decide which changes to keep, and follow up on deferred ideas.

**Start fresh.** Ignore any existing scratchpad subfolders from previous investigations. They belong to earlier sessions and their context, scripts, and findings are not relevant to your current task. Always create a new dated subfolder for your investigation.

**Import path depth:** Scripts in dated subfolders are 6 levels below the repo root (`.github/skills/auto-perf-optimize/scratchpad/YYYY-MM-DD-name/script.mts`), not 4 like the checked-in `scripts/*.mts` runners. Adjust relative imports accordingly — use 5 `..` segments to reach the repo root from a dated subfolder (e.g., `'../../../../../src/vs/base/common/stopwatch.ts'`), and `'../../scripts/userDataProfile.mts'` to reach sibling checked-in scripts.

Suggested watch loop for a scratchpad runner:

```bash
node .github/skills/auto-perf-optimize/scratchpad/<dated-folder>/scenario.mts --keep-open --iterations 1 --no-heap-snapshots --port 9224 --output .build/auto-perf-optimize/watch
```

While that Code window is open, inspect it with `@playwright/cli` from the repo root:

```bash
npx @playwright/cli attach --cdp=http://127.0.0.1:9224
npx @playwright/cli tab-list
npx @playwright/cli snapshot
npx @playwright/cli screenshot --filename=.build/auto-perf-optimize/watch/observation.png
```

`@playwright/cli` checkpoints:

- Run `tab-list` first. If the selected target is `about:blank` or a webview instead of the workbench, switch targets before trusting snapshots.
- Use `snapshot` to rediscover buttons, textboxes, list rows, webviews, and current accessible names. Prefer discovered state over stale selectors.
- Save screenshots inside the runner output folder or another workspace-local `.build/...` folder. Do not use `/tmp` for screenshots you expect the user to review. The output directory must already exist — `screenshot --filename` will fail with `ENOENT` if it does not. Create it with `mkdir -p <dir>` first.
- If the script is stuck, capture a screenshot and read the incremental `summary.json` before killing the window. The last submitted turn and last screenshot usually identify the missing wait condition.
- If auth is required, use `--keep-open`, let the user sign in once in the persistent default profile, close the window, then rerun the fast smoke.

When editing a scenario runner:

- Keep a stable output contract: `summary.json`, checkpoint screenshots, heap samples, optional `heap/*.heapsnapshot` files, and an `error` field on failure.
- Write summary/screenshot artifacts before long waits so failed runs are diagnosable.
- Wait for user-visible scenario completion, not arbitrary time. Prefer an observed response, progress disappearance, row-count change, editor content change, or command result.
- Validate with `--no-heap-snapshots` first. A broken runner plus a 2GB heap snapshot wastes time and hides the real failure.
- Close owned Code windows between runs unless the command intentionally uses `--keep-open` or `--reuse`.

## Verify Before Analyzing

Read the run's `summary.json` before opening heap snapshots. Check:

- `error` is absent
- the iteration count matches what the scenario was asked to do
- `analysis.postFirstIterationUsedBytes` and its per-iteration counterpart are present for multi-iteration memory probes
- requested snapshot labels exist under `heap/`
- screenshots show the requested workflow and settled UI

Prefer a warmed-up baseline such as `03-iteration-01.heapsnapshot` over startup snapshots. Startup, extension activation, and first-use loads are expected allocations.

## Compare a Runner Result

After capture, use heap-snapshot-analysis. A minimal scratchpad comparison script looks like this:

```javascript
import path from 'node:path';
import { compareSnapshots, printComparison } from '../helpers/compareSnapshots.ts';

const runDir = process.env.RUN;
if (!runDir) {
	throw new Error('Set RUN to a runner output directory');
}

const before = path.join(runDir, 'heap', '03-iteration-01.heapsnapshot');
const after = path.join(runDir, 'heap', '03-iteration-08.heapsnapshot');
printComparison(compareSnapshots(before, after));
```

Run it from the heap-snapshot-analysis skill folder:

```bash
cd .github/skills/heap-snapshot-analysis
RUN=../../../.build/auto-perf-optimize/<run-folder> node --max-old-space-size=16384 scratchpad/compare-run.mjs
```

## New VS Code Scenarios

When the user describes a scenario, ask only for the missing essentials: what action starts the scenario, what counts as one repeatable iteration, what indicates the UI is settled, and whether the profile should be persistent or temporary.

**Write new scenario runners in the [scratchpad](./scratchpad/) folder.** This folder is gitignored — use it freely for one-off investigation scripts. If a runner proves generally useful, promote it to `scripts/` with documentation and validation.

Put each investigation in a **dated subfolder** (see "Develop and Watch a Runner" for the naming convention).

Example scratchpad workflow:

```bash
# Create a dated investigation folder
mkdir -p .github/skills/auto-perf-optimize/scratchpad/2026-04-09-editor-tab-leak

# Write a runner inside it
cat > .github/skills/auto-perf-optimize/scratchpad/2026-04-09-editor-tab-leak/scenario.mts << 'EOF'
// ... your scenario using patterns from the checked-in scripts
EOF

# Validate without snapshots first
node .github/skills/auto-perf-optimize/scratchpad/2026-04-09-editor-tab-leak/scenario.mts \
  --iterations 3 --no-heap-snapshots --skip-prelaunch \
  --user-data-dir .build/auto-perf-optimize/user-data

# Then capture targeted snapshots
node .github/skills/auto-perf-optimize/scratchpad/2026-04-09-editor-tab-leak/scenario.mts \
  --iterations 10 --heap-snapshot-label baseline --heap-snapshot-label final \
  --skip-prelaunch --user-data-dir .build/auto-perf-optimize/user-data

# Write findings.md when the investigation concludes
```

Reuse these patterns in every runner:

- launch `scripts/code.sh` or `scripts/code.bat`
- pass `--enable-smoke-test-driver`, `--disable-workspace-trust`, a known `--remote-debugging-port`, explicit `--user-data-dir`, explicit `--extensions-dir`, `--skip-welcome`, and `--skip-release-notes`
- use a **throwaway workspace** (`--workspace <scratch-folder>`) instead of the repo root so the scenario cannot modify real source files
- connect Playwright with `chromium.connectOverCDP`
- wait for `globalThis.driver?.whenWorkbenchRestored?.()`
- enable CDP `Performance` and `HeapProfiler`
- collect garbage before memory samples
- write screenshots at important checkpoints
- write a machine-readable `summary.json` incrementally, especially before long waits
- support `--no-heap-snapshots` and targeted snapshot labels so validation stays fast
- make cleanup explicit: close the CDP browser, terminate owned Code processes, and preserve user-provided profiles

Keep scenario-specific UI selectors and wait logic in the scenario runner. Avoid promoting a runner to a generic abstraction unless multiple proven scenarios share the exact same lifecycle.

## Handoff to Heap Snapshot Analysis

Use heap-snapshot-analysis when you need to:

- compare two `.heapsnapshot` files by constructor/object group
- find direct retainers or paths to GC roots
- inspect why a particular class, model, widget, editor input, or DOM tree survived
- write investigation-specific scratchpad analysis against parsed snapshots

The output of this workflow is evidence: run summaries, screenshots, heap samples, targeted snapshots, comparison output, and retainer paths. Use that evidence to form a concrete leak hypothesis, then fix the product code and verify the fix with another run.

## Root-Cause, Don't Treat Symptoms

A surface-level observation ("this Map is growing") is not a diagnosis. Before writing a fix, understand **why** the code is structured the way it is:

1. **Use `git blame` and `git log`** on the leaking code. Read the commit message, the PR description, and any linked issues. A guard like `if (this._isDisposed) return` may exist because removing it once caused crashes — understand the original intent before changing it.
2. **Trace the full lifecycle**, not just the leak site. If `disposeContext()` is silently dropped, ask: why is the parent disposed before the child? Is the disposal order wrong, or is the guard wrong? The answer determines whether you fix the guard, fix the disposal order, or add a different cleanup path.
3. **Distinguish caches from leaks.** A Map that grows but has a trim/eviction mechanism (like `UriIdentityService._canonicalUris` with its 2^16 limit) is a cache, not a leak. Don't "fix" caches unless they lack any eviction policy.
4. **Look for the design-level problem.** If transient objects register in a global singleton and the singleton never unregisters them, the fix isn't just adding a `delete` call — ask whether the registration should happen at all for transient objects, or whether an intermediate scoped registry should exist.
5. **Check for prior art.** Search the codebase for similar patterns that handle the same lifecycle correctly. If a sibling pool/service already disposes in-use items on clear, follow that pattern. If nothing else does, understand why before introducing a new contract.

The goal is to fix the **cause**, not paper over the **effect**. A fix that adds cleanup code without understanding why cleanup was missing will often introduce new bugs or re-break a previous fix.

## Fix, Don't Just Report

The goal of this workflow is to **ship fixes**, not produce reports. After identifying leaks:

1. **Make product-code changes** that address the root cause. Common patterns:
   - Pools that `clear()` idle items but leave `_inUse` orphaned — also dispose `_inUse` on clear
   - Global service maps (`ContextKeyService._contexts`, `HoverService._managedHovers`, `UriIdentityService._canonicalUris`) that grow because transient objects register but never unregister
   - Disposable chains where `_register(service.createScoped(...))` is correct but the parent `dispose()` is never called
   - Observable subscriptions (`autorunIterableDelta` `lastValues`) that retain stale model references

2. **Verify the fix** by rerunning the same scenario with the same snapshot labels. Compare the `postFirst*UsedBytes` trend and the snapshot diff. A successful fix should show flat or decreasing memory in the iteration phase.

3. **Run all tests.** Before finishing, run all unit tests and integration tests for any files you changed. Unit tests in this repo are expected to be stable — any unit test failure is very likely caused by your changes and must be fixed. Integration tests are slightly more prone to flakiness, but failures should still be investigated.

4. **Document results** in the scratchpad `findings.md` and session memory before declaring done: what leaked, what was fixed, before/after measurements.

Do not stop at analysis. If you have evidence of a leak, attempt a fix. If the fix is unclear or risky, explain why and propose alternatives.
